# Assignment

 1. Refer to [Q2](https://github.com/karimsa/web-app-dev/blob/master/readings/08-14.md#assignment) in the assignment for 08/14. What is the appropriate command for writing cat then bat? (*Hint:* this was the most basic command you learned but you will need to research what flag to use to do this.)
 2. In your parent directory, there is a folder named 'stuff'. In 'stuff', there is a file named 'things.txt'. The following are the contents for this file:

```text
aftermath
achromat
allopath
acrobat
bath
aerosat
beneath
aerostat
bequeath
afloat
birdbath
airboat
```

What command would you use to print every other line starting with the line that has `aftermath`? (*Hint*: you've already learned the command for this, you just need to use the right flag and argument)
What command would you use to do every other line starting with `achromat`?

 3. Write the full command using the list utility that lists all files in the current directory:

    1. with their details including file permissions, owner, and date of creation.
    2. including hidden files.
    3. including hidden files but only having one file per line.
