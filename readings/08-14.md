## Assignment

 1. What are the two ways to create newlines (on Unix and Windows)?

 2. A program needs to write "bat" onto the console but it has only written "cat" so far. By printing only two more characters, how would you change "cat" to "bat"? (*Hint:* this has to do with the previous question)

 4. Research and write down the reason for (or an example of) each HTTP status code:

   - 200
