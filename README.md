# Introduction to Web Application Development

This is the repository with the course content for 'Introduction to Web Application Development'.

This README will act as an informal syllabus file and all folders in this repo will represent the
various lessons and lesson-related materials. You can download and view these at your leisure, although
there is no guarantee that these will remain the same materials when they are used but I do promise to
push all changes as I make them.

## Schedule

Class will occur every Tuesday and Thursday of July & August (14 classes total
starting on July 12th and lasting till August 30th). Each class will occur between 12 PM EST and 3 PM EST.
The classes will be separated into a lesson, practical live coding example, and
then some time to work on your own projects.

The idea is to focus on the conceptual components of web application development as these are the most skipped over during
tutorials and in school courses.

Note: The following is a tentative list of the classes. This will most likely be under work and due for changes all throughout
the course. Either in between other lessons, or towards the end, there will be some miscellaneous topics covered or catch-up
classes (that's why only 15 lessons are planned). Under the title of each class, there is a short list of topics to be covered.
