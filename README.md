# Introduction to Web Application Development

This is the repository with the course content for 'Introduction to Web Application Development'.

This README will act as an informal syllabus file and all folders in this repo will represent the
various lessons and lesson-related materials. You can download and view these at your leisure, although
there is no guarantee that these will remain the same materials when they are used but I do promise to
push all changes as I make them.

## Intended Audience

This course is aimed at young students (between the ages of 16 and 25) hoping to enhance their portfolios by adding the
valuable workplace skills of web application development. Students are recommended to have some prior programming experience,
but it is not required.

## Outcome

The intended outcome for this course is to have students in a position where they can create basic web applications with at
the standard expected in open-source development.

## Requirements

Students are encouraged to bring their own computers. There are a limited number of laptops available for using during class
by the Don Mills Computer Centre, but you will still at least need a computer at home that you can use for working on assignments.
All required tools will be acquired through guided installations as they are required in the course.

**Fluency in spoken and written English is a must.**

## Work & Assignments

The best practice for a working environment is a working environment. For this purpose, all students will be asked to think of a
family member or friend who could benefit from a small web application. The only restrictions to this web application will be
that it cannot be a static website, it must have some end-to-end features such as a live google maps implementation, a messenger,
etc. Throughout this course, students will work little by little on the web applications for their clients, and hopefully use the
lessons learned to improve the web applications.

## Schedule

Class will occur every Tuesday and Thursday of July & August (14 classes total
starting on July 12th and lasting till August 30th). Each class will occur between 12 PM EST and 3 PM EST.
The classes will be separated into a lesson, practical live coding example, and
then some time to work on your own projects.

The idea is to focus on the conceptual components of web application development as these are the most skipped over during
tutorials and in school courses.

Note: The following is a tentative list of the classes. This will most likely be under work and due for changes all throughout
the course. Either in between other lessons, or towards the end, there will be some miscellaneous topics covered or catch-up
classes (that's why only 15 lessons are planned). Under the title of each class, there is a short list of topics to be covered.

### Optional Topics

There are two open spots in the schedule for optional topics from the following:

 - **Databases & Build Systems**
   - SQL vs. NoSql databases, CRUD, injection, saving passwords. + make/npm as build systems.
 - **Asynchronous Navigation**
   - ajax for content, nav transitions, the history API.
 - **Developing RESTful APIs**
   - RESTful design of APIs over HTTP/HTTPS; basic vs. digest authentication; CRUD over REST; ajax with REST.
 - **A Guide to Successful Debugging**
   - An approach to debugging; do’s and do not’s.

There will be time to pitch topic ideas in case there is something you'd like us to focus on!
