It is not limited to those people who are in a computer science or engineering career path. In fact, I have found that there are many students in many diverse disciplines including health science who wish to learn web application development to create a bridge between computer science and their individual disciplines. This allows for many interesting applications to be created such as electronic medical record managers, intelligent financial analytics tools, and much more."
