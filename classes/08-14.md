## **Lesson 2:** What on Earth is a web app?

Note: W3 - A system to globally distribute information on the internet.

---

## The Web Browser

 - Always a native application
 - Flow of displaying a web app:
  - Render HTML top to bottom.
  - If there are any asset imports, fetch assets and process them.
  - If CSS is loaded, render using CSS engine and re-render whenever the HTML updates.
  - If JS is loaded, execute the code using the JS engine.

---

## The Web Server

 - Websites are stored as a group of resources on a web server.
 - The server is essentially responsible for content delivery.
 - Web browsers request a web page (written in HTML) from the server.
 - During loading of the page, the browser will request all needed assets from the server.

---

## Sandboxing

 - Websites live only within the confines of the web browser.
 - The web browser restricts websites into a sandbox with no OS access.
 - Websites can only access limited resources as allowed by the browser.
 - For this reason, web apps are often thought to be limited and useless.

----

## The Strengths of a Web App

 - All OS-related access (networking, filesystems, etc.) can be handled on the backend.
 - The front-end is very capable of adjusting to every platform that supports a web browser.
 - Nothing is ever compiled and so you can get rid of the concepts of:
  - Software updates
  - Prerequisites
  - System requirements
  - Administrator access

## The Networking Specifics

 - All web traffic happens over TCP.
 - Port 80 is for regular web traffic.
 - Port 443 is for secure web traffic.
 - These are defaults but other ports are allowed.
 - For example, entering `google.com:8080` in your browser will use port 8080.
