# Welcome!

Note:

Thanks for signing up and attending this course.

I hope that everyone has a wonderful experience.

----

## Pace

 - In-class teachings will keep up with class average.
 - TAs are present for the purpose of helping students who would like extra help.
 - TAs as well as the teacher will be available via email outside of class time to answer questions.

----

## Assignments

 - There will be regular assignments to help you learn to properly apply the lessons.
 - All assignments are mandatory.
 - There are supplemental exercises for people that would like extra practice.
 - There are advanced exercises for people that would like to challenge themselves.

----

## Readings & Quizzes

 - There will be regular readings **required** to keep up with the course.
 - There will be **no quizzes**.
 - Whenever possible, we will live code projects together.
    - Every person will be responsible for creating a separate part of the project.
    - Due to this, *if you do not keep up with readings, your **entire** group will suffer.*

---

## Cumulative Project

 - The best practice for a working environment is a working environment.
 - Think of a family member or friend that would benefit from a web application.
 - Either contact this person and ask if you can create it for them,
 - or create it just for fun.

----

## Requirements & Time Spent

 - You may work in pairs of two or alone.
 - There will be time after some classes to work on your projects.
 - You must also work on your projects at home.
 - Try to incorporate as many of the lessons you learn as possible.

----

## The Grand Prize

 - The top 3 projects will receive a *secret grand prize*.

## **Lesson 1:** What on Earth is a web app?

---

## The Layers of a Computer

 - Basic Input and Output System (BIOS) is responsible for communication with all hardware.
 - Operating System (OS) is the software responsible for acting as a host.
    - It runs user-level applications.
    - Provides software known as `drivers` for application to communicate with hardware.
    - Controls the remaining layers.

---

## The Filesystem Layer

 - Filesystem is responsible for long-term data storage and retreival.
 - The hardware behind the filesystem is the hard drive(s).
 - There are two means of data organization:
    - A packet of data is referred to as a `file`.
    - A group of these packets is known as a `directory` (often referred to as a folder).
    - A file *cannot* be within another file, only within a directory.
    - A directory *can* be within another directory.

----

## Notes on the Filesystem

 - The location of a file or directory is referred to as the `path`.
 - Within a path, names of files and directories are separated using a `path separator`.
    - On Unix-based systems, the path separator is `/`. (i.e. `/path/to/my/file.txt`)
    - On Windows, the path separator is `\`. (i.e. `\path\to\my\file.txt`)

----

## Question

 - Given the principles of the filesystem, how would you tell what names belong to files and which ones are directories?
 - For instance: `/a/b/c/d` (name the type for each of the letters).

----

## The Filesystem Tree

 - The top-most directory in any OS is referred to as the `root` directory.
 - The name of the directory is not `root`, that is simply what it is referred to as.
 - The name of the root directory is the same as the path separator.
 - When a file or directory is nested in another directory, we can say that it is the child of the other directory.
 - Therefore, the other directory is the parent of this file or directory.

---

## The Networking Layer

 - Responsible for inter-device communication.
 - Underlying *internal* hardware is known as the Network Interface Card (NIC).
 - Networking involves much *external* hardware as well.

----

## Internet Protocol Address

 - An IP address is an address of a device on a network.
 - The format of an IP address is predefined.
 - IPv4 addresses (most common) format: four groups of decimal digits (8 bit groups).
  - For example: 192.168.1.101
 - IPv6 address format: eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (16 bit groups).
  - For example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

----

## The Router

 - Creates a local network for inter-device communication for all connected devices.
 - Manages communication between local network and the internet.
 - For devices, communication on the local network and devices on the internet is almost identical.
 - Assigns a local IP address to all devices, including itself.
 - Routers have a local IP **and** a public IP.

----

## The Local Area Network (LAN + WLAN)

![](img/WLAN.png) <!-- .element: style="width: 500px;" -->

----

## Ports

 - There are 65536 (or 2^16) `ports` on any given device.
 - Ports are where all data between devices are sent from and to.
 - Ports are specified by integers. (i.e. the first port is 1, the last is 65536)
 - Ports < 1024 can only be accessed by applications with administrative access.
 - There are two main protocols which can be used to network: TCP &amp; UDP.

----

## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

 - Known as a `best-effort` protocol.

![](img/udp.png) <!-- .element: class="fragmentize" -->

----

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

 - Requires an on-going connection between hosts.
 - Each host must continuously acknowledge received and sent data.
 - This keeps both hosts up-to-date on each other's presence.

![](img/tcp.png) <!-- .element: class="fragmentize" -->

----

## Notes on Networking

 - For a device to receive data over a network, it must have an application that binds onto a port.
 - For a device to send data over a network, it needs the IP address and port of the receiver.

----

## Public Routing

 - When communicating with devices over the internet, you specify the external device's router's public IP.
 - The router then forwards (or *routes*) the connection through to the device on the LAN.
 - But what about when IP addresses change? And aren't IPs too complicated for users to specify?

----

### Domain Name System (DNS)

 - DNS is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
 - Domain names are alpha numeric names that can be bought from Domain Registrars.
 - There are only a set number of top-level domains. (i.e. `com`, `ca`, `org`, `co`)
 - Your domain name must have a top-level domain attached to it.
 - Your domain may have as many sub-domains as you would like (i.e. `images`.google.com, `docs`.google.com)
 - Your sub-domains can have sub-domains. (i.e. `scontent`.xx.fbcdn.com)
