## **Lesson 6:** The Space where you Code

---

## What you need to download

 - Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

----

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

 - A big fancy term for the environment within which you write your code.
 - Environments built for low-level languages typically include a compiler.
 - We will use a simple environment that simply has a text editor.
 - The benefit of using an IDE instead of Notepad is that the IDE has:
  - `Syntax highlighting`: various keywords in your code are automatically highlighted.
  - `Autocompletion`: your IDE will guess how you wish to complete your code which saves time.

## Why VSCode?

 - `Intellisense` is MS's famous auto-completion engine, it is included in VSCode
 - `Emmett`: auto-expands HTML code (we will use this next class).
 - Built-in support for Git
