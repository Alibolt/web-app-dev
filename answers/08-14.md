# Answer Key for 08/14

 1. What are the two ways to create newlines (on Unix and Windows)?

  - Unix: LF (or `\n`).
  - Windows: CRLF (or `\r\n`).

 2. A program needs to write `bat` onto the console but it has only written `cat` so far. By only printing two more characters, how would you change `cat` to `bat`?

  - `bat` and `cat` are only one letter apart
  - Therefore, we need to tell the computer to overwrite the first letter of the word.
  - Therefore the two characters would be `\r` and then ``b`.

 3. What ports are used for regular and secure web traffic?

  - 80: regular web traffic. (HTTP)
  - 443: secure web traffic. (HTTPS)

 4. Research and write down the reason for (or an example of) each HTTP status code:

  - 200: OK (all was successful).
  - 301: Moved Permenantly (the resource was permenantly moved to another URL).
  - 302: Found (the resource was found at a different location).
  - 401: Unauthorized (you are not authorized to fetch this resource).
  - 404: Not Found (no resource was found at this URL).
  - 500: Internal Server Error (something has gone wrong on the server)
